What have I done :question:

This is my first lab using OOP. I got acquainted with the concepts of OOP:  inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.

:white_check_mark: The task was as follows:

Build a hierarchy of classes for displaying graphic shapes: rectangle, ellipse, etc. Distribute classes by modules. Create a list of shapes as a separate class. In the main module of the program, add various shapes to the list, and then load the drawing of the list of shapes.
